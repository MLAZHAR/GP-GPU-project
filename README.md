# GP-GPU-project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the RTL and testbench implementation of a **Tiny-GPU architecture**, developed as part of an **academic evaluation project** for obtaining the **Licence degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)**.

The project focuses on the study and implementation of a simplified Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architecture to enhance understanding of parallel processing, instruction control, and modular hardware design using hardware description languages.
---
## Academic Context
- **Degree**: Licence in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)
- **Project Type**: Academic evaluation project
- **Purpose**: Educational study and practical implementation of GPU architecture concepts

This project is intended **strictly for educational and academic evaluation purposes**.
---
## Design and Simulation Environment
The hardware design is described using **SystemVerilog**, which allows the use of advanced language features for clear, compact, and maintainable RTL code.
Simulation and functional verification are performed using **ModelSim**, where individual modules and system-level behavior are tested through dedicated testbenches.
---
## Hardware Implementation
As part of the project objectives, the Tiny-GPU architecture is planned to be **implemented on an FPGA board**. This step aims to validate the design in real hardware and bridge the gap between simulation and physical implementation.
